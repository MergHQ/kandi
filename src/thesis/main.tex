%% History:
%% December 2020 Veli Mäkinen removed obsolete options related to 40 cr theses
%% May 2019 Tomi Männistö, Antti-Pekka Tuovinen proofreading; 30 vs. 40 cr theses, etc.
%% May 2019 Tomi Männistö changed from babelbib to bibtex; Abstract page (and other pages as well) reformatting.
%% January–May 2019 several issues fixed by Niko Mäkitalo; long fields in abstract
%% March 2018 template file extended by Lea Kutvonen to exploit HYthesisML.cls.
%% Feb2018 This template file for the use of HYgraduML.cls was  modified by Veli Mäkinen from HY_fysiikka_LuKtemplate.tex
%% authored by Roope Halonen ja Tomi Vainio in 2017.
%% Some text is also inherited from engl_malli.tex versions by Kutvonen, Erkiö, Mäkelä, Verkamo, Kurhila, and

%% Write your abstract to be positioned here.
%% You can make several abstract pages (if you want it in different languages),
%% but you should also then redefine some of the above parameters in the proper
%% language as well, in between the abstract definitions.

\begin{abstract}

Tämä dokumentti on tarkoitettu Helsingin yliopiston tietojenkäsittelytieteen osaston opin\-näyt\-teiden ja harjoitustöiden ulkoasun ohjeeksi ja mallipohjaksi. Ohje soveltuu kanditutkielmiin, ohjelmistotuotantoprojekteihin, seminaareihin ja maisterintutkielmiin. Tämän ohjeen lisäksi on seurattava niitä ohjeita, jotka opastavat valitsemaan kuhunkin osioon tieteellisesti kiinnostavaa, syvällisesti pohdittua sisältöä.


Työn aihe luokitellaan  
ACM Computing Classification System (CCS) mukaisesti, 
ks.\ \url{https://www.acm.org/about-acm/class},
käyttäen komentoa \verb+\classification{}+. 
Käytä muutamaa termipolkua (1--3), jotka alkavat juuritermistä ja joissa polun tarkentuvat luokat erotetaan toisistaan oikealle osoittavalla nuolella.

\begin{abstract}
Use this otherlanguage environment to write your abstract in another language if needed.

Topics are classified according to the ACM Computing Classification System
(CCS), see 
\url{https://www.acm.org/about-acm/class}:
check command \verb+\classification{}+. A small set of paths (1--3) should be used, starting from any top nodes
referred to bu the root term CCS leading to the leaf nodes. The elements
in the path are separated by right arrow, and emphasis of each element individually can be indicated
by the use of bold face for high importance or italics for intermediate
level. The combination of individual boldface terms may give the reader
additional insight.
